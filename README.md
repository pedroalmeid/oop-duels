This repository is the code implemented for a college assignment in the subject of “Object-Oriented Programming”, where I was assigned to develop a simple 2D board game of characters duels based on the functionality requirements established by the professor.

- Maven was used configured to generate a terminal program
- The focus of the game is not on the balance between the characters, but it was intended to be a good first contact experience with Java and object-oriented programming.
- I implemented three packages: logs (for messages, errors and warnings), character (for the hierarchy of character classes) and game (for running the game in the terminal).
